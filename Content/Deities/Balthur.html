    <h1>Balthur</h1>
      <p>BalthuR is the god of purity and health. He is the healer of the sick and the wounded. He can cure any disease or injury with his touch or his words. He is also the purifier of the souls and the minds. He is one of the five children of Erthi, the goddess of the earth. He is also the brother of UnaR, Wotan, Freya, and HadR. He has no lover. He is often depicted as a young man with a lyre and a staff.
He has various relationships with other gods and humans. He has a complex relationship with HadR, the god of night, and is the only god allowed in Hadr's realm. His closest ally is Erthi, his mother, who shares his love for life and nature. Freya, his sister, admires him but clashes with him over their interests and goals. He has many followers who worship him as a benevolent god who can heal their wounds and purify their souls. Some symbols that represent him are the venomous snake and the giant swan. He is associated with youth, innocence, and water.
