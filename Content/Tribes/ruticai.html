        <p>Talon’s peak is a mountain top hamlet, nuzzled into a crevice where the wind doesn’t rake the mountainside. Talon’s Peak is so located due to an iron mine which is the primary source of the Ruticuli’s iron. Residents of Talon’s peak are proud of their warrior heritage and are frequently in Shield harbor at the proving grounds. The mining work done in Talon’s peak has made it the richest Ruticuli settlement in the post raiding era.</p>

        <p>Fisherman’s wharf was once a lively fishing hamlet with many visitors who were passing through on their way to Shield Harbor. At the end of the summer, Fervir, Sabalingi and other tribes traveled to shield harbor buy what the Ruticli had looted on their raids. Now Fisherman’s Wharf is a shadow of its former self, sporting empty docks and salt cracked faces of hardened warriors without any opportunity to use their skills. One of the most striking features of fisherman’s wharf is the dozen or so vessels which were dragged up onto land, scuttled, and left to rot.</p>

        <p>The largest settlement of the Ruticuli is still merely a small hamlet of a few hundred.  Seaspear is home of the most religious members of the Ruticuli, who converted the tribe to Asatru after the massacre. The tribesmen that live here eak out a living hunting and gathering berries and vegetables.  Seaspear is a ring of some 45 shoddily built wooden structures, rimmed by the forest a couple hundred feet away.  Seaspear is off the beaten path. They rarely see a visitor from another tribe.</p>

        <p>Shield harbor is the primary port and a site of great historical significance for the Ruticuli. Though the origin of the tribe is shrouded in mystery, it is believed that Shield harbor was the first settlement of the tribe.  For hundreds of years, the dreaded Ruticuli fleet set sail each summer from Shield Harbor and brought destruction and ruin to many a foe. Shield harbor is home to three important annual celebrations of the Ruticuli: the awakening, the Al-thing, and the first lights.
The awakening is a coming of age festival at the end of winter in which all the young men from every Ruticuli family gather in Shield harbor and go on their first hunt. This is a very dangerous undertaking for these inexperienced young tribesmen and usually at least one perishes on their hunt, but such is life in Thule. The young man who brings back the most impressive and most dangerous game is crowned the prince of the Ruticuli, which is a coveted title and brings honor and respect to his family all year.
The Al-thing is a mid-winter event in which all the noble men of the Ruticuli gather to discuss what to do for the year, often picking the targets of the summer raids. The first thing that happens at the Al-thing is the vote for Mayking. From a few nominated candidates, the nobles vote for the next mayking and the winner holds the title for the rest of the year. The mayking’s family is highly honored and guarded by the prestigious warriors of shield harbor. After a Mayking is selected, he may appoint up to five men to join the hearthguard of shield harbor, and must dismiss a man for each one he has appointed. Being appointed to the hearthguard of Shield Harbor is amongst the highest honors for a warrior of the Ruticuli. The Mayking must provide for these men all year, and the mayking is expected to be generous. The Mayking’s vote is weighted very heavily against his tribesmen, and generally his decisions are obeyed.  After the Mayking is appointed, the tribesmen will debate publicly the plans for the year while the Mayking listens, unspeaking. After days of discussion, the mayking then nominates from those proposed, a few plans. After this, a vote is cast deciding the general course of action for the tribe until the next Al-thing.
The First Lights is a raucous drunken celebration that happens as soon as the sun first returns from the winter dark.  It goes on for 5 days and the Jarls of each settlement compete to show who is the most generous. Warriors gather in the proving grounds to show who is best and many duels to the blood occur. The Al-thing begins only a few days after the First Lights.
